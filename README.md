# CTCF

<!-- badges: start -->

[![Lifecycle:
experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

Genomic coordinates of CTCF binding sites with motif MA0139.1 (Jaspar),
in BED format, with strand orientation (directionality of binding).
Human (hg19, hg38) and mouse (mm9, mm10) genomes. The binding sites were
detected using the FIMO tool of the MEME suite using default settings.
Extra columns include motif name (MA0139.1), score, p-value, q-value,
and the motif sequence.

Experimental, to be submitted as an AnnotatiohHub Bioconductor package.

## Installation instructions

<!--
Get the latest stable `R` release from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `CTCF` using from [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) the following code:


```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("CTCF")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/mdozmorov/CTCF) with:
-->

``` r
BiocManager::install("mdozmorov/CTCF")
```

## Example

``` r
# hg38 CTCF coordinates
download.file(url = "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1s70dQy_zSSP8rsMa9VPEQS1DvUF-bA8o", destfile = "CTCF_hg38.RData")
load(file = "CTCF_hg38.RData")
CTCF_hg38
```

See [inst/scripts/make-data.R](inst/scripts/make-data.R) how to create
the CTCF GRanges objects.

<!--
This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:


```r
library("CTCF")
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:


```r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!

run this yourself to check for any updates on how to cite **CTCF**.

``` r
print(citation("CTCF"), bibtex = TRUE)
#> 
#> Mikhail, Dozmorov, mikhail.dozmorov@gmail.com (2021). _CTCF_.
#> https://github.com/mdozmorov/CTCF/CTCF - R package version 0.0.1, <URL:

Please note that the `CTCF` was only made possible thanks to many other
R and bioinformatics software authors, which are cited either in the
vignettes and/or the paper(s) describing this package.

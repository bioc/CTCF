Description: Genomic coordinates of CTCF binding sites with motif MA0139.1 
    (Jaspar), in BED format. With strand orientation (directionality of binding). 
    Human (hg19, hg38) and mouse (mm9, mm10) genomes. The binding sites were 
    detected using the FIMO tool of the MEME suite using default settings. 
    Extra columns include motif name (MA0139.1), score, p-value, q-value, and 
    the motif sequence.
